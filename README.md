# HTML-CSS-capstone-project (Online shop for footwear)

>
This is a project for the HTML & CSS capstone project: Online shop for electronics (https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX).
The Project is based on an online shop for electronics. I personalized the content, instead of a shop of electronics I built a page for the store for footwears.
I followed the best practices in HTML, CSS and in GitHub process flow.
